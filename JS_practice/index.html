    <p id="htmltext">Does she need to be an empathetic leader? Ask about that. Does she need to 
        take your company public? Ask about that. If you're the candidate, talk about why 
        you took certain jobs. Explain why you left. Explain why you chose a certain 
        school. Share why you decided to go to grad school. Discuss why you took a year 
        off to backpack through Europe, and what you got out of the experience. What 
        are your biggest weaknesses? Every candidate knows how to answer this 
        question: Just pick a theoretical weakness and magically transform that flaw into 
        a strength in disguise! For example: "My biggest weakness is getting so absorbed 
        in my work that I lose all track of time. Every day I look up and realize everyone 
        has gone home! I know I should be more aware of the clock, but when I love what 
        I'm doing I just can't think of anything else." So your "biggest weakness" is that 
        you'll put in more hours than everyone else? Great. What are your biggest 
        strengths? I'm not sure why interviewers ask this question; your resume and 
        experience should make your strengths readily apparent! Even so, if you're asked, 
        provide a sharp, on-point answer. Be clear and precise! If you're a great problem 
        solver, don't just say that: Provide a few examples, pertinent to the opening, 
        that prove you're a great problem solver! If you're an emotionally intelligent 
        leader, don't just say that!</p>
